# ðŸ§  SymbolicCoreLLM â€“ Exploring Symbolic Language Interfaces in LLMs

## Overview
**SymbolicCoreLLM** is an experimental prototype exploring how symbolic, ideographic, or pictographic elements can serve as the primary tokenization layer in language models. Instead of relying on subword or character-level embeddings alone, this project tests the feasibility of symbolic representations as inputs for small-scale LLM architectures.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Character-level symbolic tokenizer for English samples.
- Minimal LSTM-based LLM to process symbolic sequences.
- Easy-to-train PyTorch pipeline with `Dataset`, `Tokenizer`, and `Generator`.
- Focused on foundational support for ancient script-like representations.

## ðŸ§© Why Symbolic Language?
Unlike linear text, **symbols are compact, multi-semantic, and visually distinguishable**â€”making them an ideal candidate for AI interfaces that aim for universality and minimal reliance on alphabetic literacy. This approach also aligns well with cognitive models in early language learning and communication.
